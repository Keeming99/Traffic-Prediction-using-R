# Traffic-Prediction-using-R
This is a project done during my Sem 1 MDS

In this project you will know how to use Random Forest to predict the traffic situation (classification in categorizing traffic situations).

Besides that, this project also used Linear Regression to Predict the total numeber of vehicles on road at a specific time.
